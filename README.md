PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, enhanced with Artificial Intelligence to allow the snake to learn how to play on its own. The game can be played in two modes: manually by the player or automatically by an AI agent trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms like Q-Learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
The primary goal is to create an intelligent snake that learns how to survive longer, collect more food, and avoid collisions through continuous interaction with the environment.
